# Statistical-Data-Analysis-Megaline

## Project Objective

This data science project aims to provide Megaline with the insights required to identify the prepaid plan, either Surf or Ultimate, that generates higher revenue. By analyzing the behavior of 500 selected Megaline clients, this analysis will unveil patterns and trends necessary for informed decisions regarding plan promotion and adjustments. The project involves data exploration and cleaning, including the identification of missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Statistical analysis and data visualizations will offer insights into client behavior, monthly usage, call duration, and other relevant characteristics. Utilizing statistical tests, we will assess the significant differences in revenue between Surf and Ultimate plans. Additionally, predictive models will be developed to estimate the potential revenue generated by promoting one plan over the other.

Ultimately, our goal is to empower Megaline's commercial department to make data-driven decisions to optimize their advertising budget and prepaid plan offerings.

## Description of the plans

**Note:** Megaline rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.

**Surf Plan**
- Monthly charge: $20
- 500 monthly minutes, 50 texts, and 15 GB of data

 *After exceeding the package limits:*
- 1 minute: 3 cents
- 1 text message: 3 cents
- 1 GB of data: $10

**Ultimate Plan**
- Monthly charge: $70
- 3000 monthly minutes, 1000 text messages, and 30 GB of data

*After exceeding the package limits:*
- 1 minute: 1 cent
- 1 text message: 1 cent
- 1 GB of data: $7

## Overall Conclusion

After analyzing the dataset provided by Megaline, several important conclusions can be made:

The Surf plan is more popular among users, but the Ultimate plan has higher revenue per user on average. Most users do not exceed their monthly limit for calls and messages, but many users exceed their monthly limit for internet usage.

The average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs significantly, with the Surf plan generating less revenue per user on average. Users of both plans tend to increase their usage of services over time, with the most usage in December.

Based on these conclusions, the Megaline may consider targeting marketing efforts towards the Ultimate plan in order to increase revenue per user, or creating additional plans for frequent users who exceed plan limitations.
