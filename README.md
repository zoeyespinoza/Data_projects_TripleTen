Data Collection and Storage (SQL). Collected and analyzed taxi service usage data, identifying demand patterns and weather influences using SQL to optimize service delivery and enhance customer satisfaction.|
| 7 | [Precision Model Cell Plan Matcher](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Precision-Model-Plan-Matcher) | Megaline Subscriber Plan Recommendation: Precision Model for Subscriber Plan. Refined a model for accurately matching Megaline subscribers to optimal cell plans based on usage patterns, aiming to improve customer experience and operational efficiency. |
| 8 | [Supervised Learning Churn Prediction](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Supervised-Learning-Churn-Prediction) | Supervised Learning for Customer Retention: Churn Prediction at Beta Bank. Created machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, and CatBoostClassifier that predicted which customers were at risk of leaving the telecommunications company. The selected model was a RandomForestClassifier with tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.|
| 9 | [Optimizing Profits ML Business](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Optimizing-Profits-ML-Business) | Enhancing Profitability in the Energy Sector: Leveraging Machine Learning and Business Metrics for OilyGiant. Provided metrics to boost profitability and efficiency, emphasizing data-driven decision-making for operational improvements. |
| 10 | [Predictive Modeling for Gold Optimization](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Predictive-Modeling-for-Gold-Optimization) | Predictive Modeling for Gold Recovery Optimization in Heavy Industry. Created a model to improve gold recovery processes in the mining industry, optimizing recovery stages for increased efficiency and yield, with machine learning application.|
| 11 | [Linear Algebra ML SureTomorrow Insurance](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Linear-Algebra-ML-SureTomorrow) | Enhancing Sure Tomorrow Insurance with Machine Learning. Improved customer segmentation and insurance benefit prediction using data obfuscation to protect privacy, demonstrating the balance between data security and analytical accuracy in insurance analytics. |
| 12 | [Numerical Methods Model Training](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Numerical-Methods-Model-Training) | Developing Vintage Value's Advanced Car Valuation App: Harnessing Historical Data to Drive Accurate and Swift Market Price Predictions for Used Cars |
| 13 | [Times Series Predicting Taxi Orders](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Time-Series-Predicting-Taxi-Orders) | Used time series analysis to forecast taxi order volumes, helping a taxi company efficiently allocate drivers during peak hours at airports, optimizing resources and service quality. |
| 14 | [ML for Texts Detecting Negative Movie Reviews](https://github.com/zoeyvero/ML-for-Texts-Detecting-Negative-Movie-Reviews) | Sentiment Analysis in Classic Movie Reviews: Building a Predictive Model for The Film Union. Normalization of reviews without digits or punctuation; lemmatization using NLTK and spaCy; creation of features using TF-IDF; and testing of various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, and LGBMClassifier |
| 15 | [Computer Vision Age Verification for GoodSeed](https://github.com/zoeyvero/Computer-Vision-Age-Verification-Supermarkets) | Age Verification System for Good Seed Supermarkets, using Computer Vision to implement store policies|
| 16 | [Telecom Churn Prediciton](https://github.com/zoeyespinoza/Telecom-Churn-Prediction) | Developed and evaluated several machine learning models such as XGBoost and Random Forest to predict customer churn for a telecom operator, with XGBoost emerging as the final model. The model's performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning and achieved a high ROC-AUC score, indicating strong predictive capability.
