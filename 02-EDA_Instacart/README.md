Data Analysis of Instacart Customer Patterns

# Project Description
In this project, we will be analyzing datasets from Instacart, a grocery delivery platform. The data consists of five separate CSV files: 'instacart_orders.csv', 'products.csv', 'order_products.csv', 'aisles.csv', and 'departments.csv'. This particular dataset was [publicly released](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2) by Instacart in 2017 for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview). After cleaning up the data, we can prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.
