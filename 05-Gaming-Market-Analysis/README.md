# Gaming-Market-Analysis

## Project Description:

The Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) has collected ratings starting back from 2016, and preparing a campaign for 2017. Analysis involves examining the relationship between ESRB ratings and game sales, as well as other variables such as genre and platform. A variety of statistical techniques will be used to uncover insights, such as regression analysis to identify the most important factors influencing game sales, clustering analysis to group games by similar characteristics, and classification analysis to predict which games are likely to be big winners. This will also highlight predictions based on whether or not a game will be successful. 

- What are the key determinants of a game's success in the global market?
- Can we predict which games are likely to achieve significant sales figures in 2017?
- How do ESRB ratings impact a game's performance and target audience?

## Project Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed historical data on game sales, reviews, and ratings. We started by preprocessing the data and filling in missing values. We then performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. We also created user profiles for different regions and examined how platform, genre, and ESRB ratings affect sales in different regions.

We tested two hypotheses using t-tests, by including the time period of 2014-2016 for a similar timeframe to understand predictions for 2017. The first hypothesis was that the average user ratings for the Xbox 360 and PC platforms are the same. The second hypothesis was on average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres, to see their difference.  In the case of the second test, we rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a significant difference between the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres. Analysis suggests that platform and genre have a significant impact on game sales and ratings. Developers and publishers should take these factors into consideration when creating and marketing games. The ESRB rating system also plays a role in game sales, varying by region.
